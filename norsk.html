                    In today's society, technology is taking up most of our time. We surf the internet, we watch TV, but most of all we love our phones. The smartphones in today’s society are playing a key role in nearly everyone’s life. We use them for everything. It is nearly at that point where running out of battery or losing your wifi connection is the end of the world. You store valuable information or tickets that you could need at any moment, and what is worse than going out of battery on your phone, when there is a ticket control on the bus?

                        That is when we came up with our brand Infinity Wear.

                    Our product wants to change the world by making your jacket more useful than it already is! We feel like you could get much more out of your jacket, and that is when we came up with the Infinity Jacket.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Infinity Jacket might look like any other jacket, but do not let that fool you, cause on the inside is where the difference appear. One thing that is really important for us as a company is to make sure that the jacket still has a great design and being very useful at the same time. We have seen others try to do the same, but they have not found a really good way to still make the design look cool. At the same time it was important for us to make sure that the product would not make any discomfort for the user, cause we want our jacket to be comfortable to wear as well. The Infinity Jacket is mainly going to be used during the fall/winter, but you could also use it on rainy days, since the jacket is water resistance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This jacket is great for everyone, and is supposed to work as a fall/winter jacket and at the same time as a fullfør setningen din bitch
                </p>
                <p>
                    Here you can see some of the cool features the Infinity Jacket has:

                <h2>Hvordan</h2>
                <p>
                    The Infinity Jacket is using a set of solid-state battery pack with a new type of Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, that gives 3x greater energy and has also removed the fire hazard associated with today’s batteries. Which makes the design flawless towards any hazards of having batteries in a jacket. This make sure that you could go longer without charging the jacket. It also enables the possibility to give the jacket a QI wireless charging device, which can charge any type of smartphone. You simply just put your phone in the front pocket of the jacket and you are good to go. If your phone does not support wireless charging, then we also have a usb input in the front pocket, so you could use your standard charger.
                </p>
                <input class="text1" id="visMer1" type='checkbox' />
                <more1>
                    <p>
                        There will be two different ways to charge up your jacket. The main way will be to charge the jacket in any power socket by simply pulling out the charging cable from the side pocket of the jacket. The second way requires solar power, but this is a way to make the battery last even longer by using highly advanced technology to make flexible solar panels, that uses sun power to give additional battery time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We have designed the jacket so the sunbeams go through the first layer of the jacket and getting absorbed into the flexible solar panels, but at the same time made sure that the jacket isolates the cold and keeping you warm. By having a three layered jacket we make sure that we keep the cool design by having the solar panels strategically placed around in the second layer of the jacket and the third layer is simply there to keep you warm and protect your upper body.

				<p>
                    We do not believe that this is just another gadget for the rich to embrace. Poor people in the western world will also need their phone to be charged. Infinity Wear wants to donate 10% of each sale to those in need living on the street in cold parts of the world. This money will be spent providing these people with their own infinity jacket. Keeping them warm and powered.
                </p>
				<p>
					Even though not all the people living on the street owns a phone, we believe that technology is the future for every social layer of the society. In the western world it has almost become an necessity to have access to the internet. Not to check social media, but to use government institutions and banks. That is why our jacket will make the life easier. Not only for every day Joe, but also for the unlucky people of our society. With a bonus of keeping them warm.
