                <h2>About ACE</h2>
				<p>
					Since there have been gaming, there have been those that try to infringe on other people's time and happiness by cheating in their beloved games. Hackers have cheated and made what was a level playing field for all, into an uneven playing field where they have the advantage. Currently the methods that try to stop the hackers have been insufficient and only the fewest ever get caught. That is why we invented the innovative deep learning algorithm that will hopefully put an end to the hackers reign.

                <h2>Product</h2>
                <p>
                    Our product wants to change the gaming community by solving hacking once and for all. Some of the problems the gaming community stands in front of today are aim hacking, wall hacking, speed hacking and other hacks designed to give the cheater the advantage.</p>
				<p>
                    Our solution will fix this, with the ac engine we can detect if you are hacking in real time and alert the admins faster than any other anti cheat measure on the market. We want all the games out there to be without hackers. One thing that is really important for us as a company is to assure that no games will be destroyed or ruined by hackers, and because of the great technology we have today this is possible to achieve. We have taken anti cheat systems to a new height and aiming towards a future where hacking belongs to the past. Thanks to the deep learning algorithm programmed into ACE, we can now detect hacking faster than a human and without thousands of reports.</p>
				<p>
                    Today most hackers need hundreds or thousands of reports to get automatically banned, and we believe this is too ineffective. ACE can alone decide if a player is hacking by only tracking the input from the player and compare it to the input of an average player in real time.</p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the currently supported games:</p>

            <div class="wrapper">
                <h2>How does the ac engine work ?</h2>
				<p>
					The process of enforcing anti cheat measures has long been a hard and tedious way of stopping hackers, now with the ac engine we will be able to faster and easier and cheaper than ever find and eliminate cheaters and hackers as they come. The real advantage with using our product is that the engine will be able to catch cheaters in real time, while they are still in the game.</p>
				<p>
					Currently the main focus is to be able to make the engine as easy and pain-free as possible to switch to for the developers. With our solution you would be able to just upload the raw game data and player input to the ace cloud and the engines deep learning algorithm will be at work, after a certain threshold of game data has been uploaded, ACE will begin to more accurately pinpoint the hackers. The best part of our anti cheat engine is that over time the machine will only get better.</p>
				<p>
					The engine will be operating from a remote server farm, processing data. From there it will be operating a state of the art deep learning algorithm that will process the players input and conclude if the player are cheating.</p>
