                <p>
                    Since there have been gaming, there have been those that try to infringe on other people's time and happiness by cheating in their beloved games. Hackers have cheated and made what was a level playing field for all, into an uneven playing field where they have the advantage. Currently the methods that try to stop the hackers have been insufficient and only the fewest ever get caught. That is why we invented the innovative deep learning algorithm that will hopefully put an end to the hackers reign.

                <p>
                    Our product wants to change the gaming community by solving hacking once and for all. Some of the problems the gaming community stands in front of today are aim hacking, wall hacking, speed hacking and other hacks designed to give the cheater the advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    Our solution will fix this, with the ac engine we can detect if you are hacking in real time and alert the admins faster than any other anti cheat measure on the market. We want all the games out there to be without hackers. One thing that is really important for us as a company is to assure that no games will be destroyed or ruined by hackers, and because of the great technology we have today this is possible to achieve. We have taken anti cheat systems to a new height and aiming towards a future where hacking belongs to the past. Thanks to the deep learning algorithm programmed into ACE, we can now detect hacking faster than a human and without thousands of reports.</p>
                <p>
                    Today most hackers need hundreds or thousands of reports to get automatically banned, and we believe this is too ineffective. ACE can alone decide if a player is hacking by only tracking the input from the player and compare it to the input of an average player in real time.</p>
                <p>
                    Here are some of the currently supported games:</p>

                <h2>How</h2>
                <p>
                    The Infinity Jacket is using a set of solid-state battery pack with a new type of Lithium-ion rechargeable batteries, that gives 3x greater energy and has also removed the fire hazard associated with today’s batteries. Which makes the design flawless towards any hazards of having batteries in a jacket. This make sure that you could go longer without charging the jacket. It also enables the possibility to give the jacket a QI wireless charging device, which can charge any type of smartphone. You simply just put your phone in the front pocket of the jacket and you are good to go. If your phone does not support wireless charging, then we also have a usb input in the front pocket, so you could use your standard charger.</p>
                <input class="text1" id="visMer1" type='checkbox' />
                <more1>
                    <p>
                        There will be two different ways to charge up your jacket. The main way will be to charge the jacket in any power socket by simply pulling out the charging cable from the side pocket of the jacket. The second way requires solar power, but this is a way to make the battery last even longer by using highly advanced technology to make flexible solar panels, that uses sun power to give additional battery time.</p>
                    <p>
                        We have designed the jacket so the sunbeams go through the first layer of the jacket and getting absorbed into the flexible solar panels, but at the same time made sure that the jacket isolates the cold and keeping you warm. By having a three layered jacket we make sure that we keep the cool design by having the solar panels strategically placed around in the second layer of the jacket and the third layer is simply there to keep you warm and protect your upper body.    </p>

                <h2>Cause</h2>
				<p>
					We do not believe that this is just another gadget for the rich to embrace. Poor people in the western world will also need their phone to be charged. Infinity Wear wants to donate 10% of each sale to those in need living on the street in cold parts of the world. This money will be spent providing these people with their own infinity jacket. Keeping them warm and powered.</p>
				<p>
					Even though not all the people living on the street owns a phone, we believe that technology is the future for every social layer of the society. In the western world it has almost become an necessity to have access to the internet. Not to check social media, but to use government institutions and banks. That is why our jacket will make the life easier. Not only for every day Joe, but also for the unlucky people of our society. With a bonus of keeping them warm.
