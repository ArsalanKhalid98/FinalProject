                <h2>About ACE</h2>
                <p>We got together as a group and started talking about a problem we all find very frustrating. We had some good ideas, however we did not burn for it. It was not interesting enough for us.</p>
                <p>Until we came up with a problem that was relevant for everyone in the group. We all like to play video games and if there is one thing we all hate about gaming, it is hackers.</p>
                <p>Hacking is a social problem, not only for us, but the entire gaming community. So we started thinking: “How are we going to solve this?”. </p>

                <h2>Product</h2>
					<p>
						Our product wants to change the gaming community by solving hacking once and for all. Some of the problems the gaming community stands in front of today are:
					</p>
					<p>
						<ul>
							<li>Aimbot</li>
							<li>Wallhack</li>
							<li>Speedhack</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<p>
						ACE will fix this. ACE can detect if you are hacking or if you are playing the game fair. This is how we want all the games to be. Free of hackers. 
						One thing that is really important for us as a company is to assure that no games will be destroyed or ruined by hackers.  
					</p>
					<p>
						Here are some of the supported games we have today where our product works:

                <h2>How does the ac engine work ?</h2>
                <p>The process of enforcing anti cheat measures have long been a long, hard and tedious way at stopping hackers, now with the ac engine we will be able to faster and easier and cheaper than ever find and eliminate cheaters and hackers as they come. The real advantage with using our product is that the engine will be able to catch cheaters in real time, while they are still in the game.</p>
                <p>Currently the main focus is to be able to make the engine as easy and pain-free as possible to switch to for the developers, with our solution you would be able to just upload the raw game data and player input to the ace cloud and the engines deep learning algorithm will be at work, after a certain threshold of game data has been uploaded, ACE will begin to more accurately be able to pinpoint the hackers. The best part of the our anti cheat engine is that over time the machine will only get better.</p>
                <p>The engine will be operating from a remote server farm, processing data. From there it will be operating a state of the art deep learning algorithm that will process the players input and conclude if the player are cheating.</p>
